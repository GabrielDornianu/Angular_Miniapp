This is an application i had to do a while back while having no knowledge of Angular 2, 4 or 5.
Needless to say that i couldn't get it done.

Now however after learning a little bit of Angular, i am happy to get the application done.

The basic idea is the following: 
I have to make an application for managing the candidates for a job. So, this is basically a simple application, more like a crud. The nice part is, I simulated a server that provides the data of the application, to simulate a server. 
The application communicates with the api through an angular service. 
There are three components: one for adding a candidate, one for providing the functionalities of a crud application (update and delete, to be more specific), and one to filter the candidates by their name or their skillset.

To run the application you will need to run the server for the api provider and the server for the application.
